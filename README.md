# Hello Coders
### This is a fun and useful project that I made in python
- It uses the module pyttsx3 for text to speech
- It also uses the module PyPDF2 for reading a pdf file

### This program is easily scalable and can be used to read any type of files

## The pdf that I have used came from [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfqMhTWNBTe0b2nM6JHVCnAkhQRGiZMSJ)

### Thanks for reading through this
